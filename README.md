# K-Means-Clustering-and-Principal-Component-Analysis-algorithms

The algorithm must be implemented as a function with arguments (dataset). Usage of any library that has an implementation is forbidden. 

For Principal Component Analysis, the data (without Species column) must be plotted in the first three eigenvectors and the eigenvalues for the corresponding values should also be noted. 

In clustering, two plots one showing the output of the cluster and one showing actual species should be displayed. 

The Python version to be used must be above 3.5.
